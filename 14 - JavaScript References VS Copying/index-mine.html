    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const copy3 = {...person};
    // copy3.prop3 = 'val3';
    // console.log(person, copy3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
